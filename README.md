Can't understand why a project which has been developed for many years and have many users, won't give good examples to show the features it has?

I spent several hours to make this demo work, all the information the official README gives only:

> Template inheritance is supported by this implementation, see https://github.com/mustache/spec/issues/38 (eg. {{<super}}{{$content}}...{{/content}}{{/super}})

It's not easy to GUESS the correct usage for a person who is not a pro of mustache.
